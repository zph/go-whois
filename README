# Whois Service API

## Visit

http://localhost:3000/whois/[DOMAIN TO QUERY INFO]

You may also visit
http://localhost:3000/whois/upload/csv
to upload a csv file with all the domains you wish to use.

## Storage
When provided with a valid domain name, go-whois will query the local sqlite db for that domain.
If data is found, then go-whois will return that data. If the domain is not present in the database,
then go-whois will execute a fresh whois query and store the results in the db.

## TODO

Use whois.c (from debian repos) instead of shelling out
